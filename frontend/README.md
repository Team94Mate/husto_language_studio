## Technologies were used:   

In this project, I developed a website for an online English language school using modern web development technologies:   

- **React**: Utilized React to build a dynamic and responsive user interfacey.  
- **TypeScript**: Integrated TypeScript for type safety and improved code quality, enhancing the development experience with better tooling and error checking.   
- **Context API**: Employed the Context API for state management, ensuring a predictable and consistent application state across different components.  
- **Fetch API**: function is a built-in JavaScript API for making HTTP requests. Itâ€™s used in the request function to send requests to the specified BASE_URL and handle responses. 
- **SCSS**: Styled the application using SCSS for modular and maintainable CSS, allowing for better organization and reuse of styles.  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the website is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and providing a consistent experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.  
- **Git**: Used Git for version control, tracking changes and collaborating effectively during the development process.
- **Figma**: Used Figma for its collaborative design features and prototyping capabilities, which streamlined the design process and enhanced the user experience for the online English school website.
